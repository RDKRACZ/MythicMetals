# 0.9.10
### Note!
Unembedded Cloth Config from the mod, you now have to download it yourself.  

Added dust support for Indrev and Mechanical Tech.  
Unobtainium can now spawn exposed in caves and similar, making it easier to find.  
SLightly buffed hoes and high-tier axes.  
Major interal refactors of the code.  
Added new hallowed and metallurgium armor models, as well as changing aetherium, adamantite, mythril and orichalcum ones.  
Various re-colours and texture changes.  
Added missing tags for gold and hallowed dusts.  

# 0.9.9
### Note!  
Added two new libraries: Enchant Giver and Alloy Forgery. 
You will need to download Alloy Forgery in order to use Mythic Metals! Link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alloy-forgery

EnchantGiver adds innate enchantments to aquarium and prometheum. They can be overridden with higher enchantments, but they will not disappear even if a grindstone is used.  
Alloy Forgery is a new mod that lets you build a multiblock alloy smelter. This smeltery replaces the old alloy system. Making alloys require lava and different tiers of smelters (currently only 2 tiers are in place, with nothing more planned).  
A tutorial will be available on the upcoming Mythic Metals Wiki! Once it's ready a link will be available.  

### What's new?
Added new anvils! These can be made from a selection of the metals, and will not break!  
Added new chains! These can be crafted from a selection of metals and nuggets.  
Added a new material: Hallowed. Made from the hallowed ores (adamantite, mythril and orichalcum).  
Unembedded PigLib. You will now have to install it manually, to prevent version issues.  
Added BYG, Terrestria and Traverse support! You will now find biome specific ores such as Starrite in their biomes.  
The ore generator has been changed internally so that it actually generates ores in their defined ranges. This means that worldgen has changed, and upgrading might cause funky chunk borders.  
Squashed a couple of bugs related to Harvest Scythes and Charm.  
Removed Lutetium, as it only served as a worse silver alternative.    

Adjusted most of the textures, as well as adding some new models. Thank you to:
* DH(LordDeatHunter), for a lot of the re-colours, item models and animated textures.  
* Temreno, for the new armour and tool models.  
* Tector, for the new ore and ingot textures.  
* Pois1x, for the new anvil model + texture.  
* Henchman, for new low-tier textures (copper, tin, bronze, and ur).  

### Balancing changes:  
* Quicksilver now has a higher mining level, higher dmg and speed, but less durability  
* Carmot has recieved a major buff  
* Quadrillum can now be smelted with a normal furnace  
* Slightly buffed hallowed  
* Made Kyber slightly easier to find  
* Increased Ur spawn rate  
* Buffed Banglum, Discordium, and Durasteel
* Nerfed Prometheum and Kyber  
* Buffed Metallurgium tools & weapons
* Major Stormyx buff, made it slightly easier to find  
* Slowsilver armor has been nerfed, as well as small tool nerf  
* Made tin and vermiculite spawn higher up   
* Celestium and Starrite have swapped mining speeds  

## What's next?  
Next update is mostly cleaning up before the final major release of Mythic Metals. I want to focus making addons for the mod over adding a lot more content, since I believe Mythic Metals serves the scope of adding more ores.  
Main focus will be getting even better textures for the rest of the items, ores and blocks. The first addon I wish to make is a decorations addon which would mean the chains will be moved to another mod eventually.  
There will be a few more features added, but after then the mod will mainly be maintained. I will be adding support for other mods though, but in the form extra mods.  
Thank you all for showing interest in this mod!
